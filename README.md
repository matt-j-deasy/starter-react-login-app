## Purpose

This app is meant to provide a boilerplate application with as few opinions as seems reasonable. It provides a sample authentication flow with a login page and dashboard view.

This is meant to be used as a starting point for quickly spinning off future projects.

It does use some common packages and I'll include those as opinions

Opinions:

<ul>
<li>Use commonly used packages. The more people using a package, the better.</li>
<li>Use packages that require little to no boilerplate and setup.</li>
<li>Use the same packages for every project unless there is a good reason not to</li>
<li>Most projects require the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>Global State management (Redux + Redux Toolkit)</li>
<li>Global Styling pattern (Chakra-UI)</li>
<li>Declarative Routing (React-Router)</li>
<li>Forms (React-hook-form)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
